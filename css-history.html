        <h1>CSS History</h1>

        <p id="p1" class="css-history">
            When the first website was made in 1991 by <a href="https://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/">Tim Berners
                Lee</a>, there was no styling of the content,
            it was just HTML.
            <sup><a href="https://eager.io/blog/the-languages-which-almost-were-css/">1</a></sup>
            There were different ideas about how websites should introduce styling elements.
            One idea was using HTML to code style elements. Netscape was one browser that implemented
            presentational elements directly in the HTML. Another idea was to have a stylesheet
            associated with a certain browser. Pei-Yuan Wei developed Viola in 1992,
            <sup><a href="https://css-tricks.com/look-back-history-css/">2</a></sup>
            a browser with its own built in style sheet language.
            <sup><a href="http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q4/0264.html ">3</a></sup><br>
            <br>
            There also came a push for the styling of the HTML elements to be seperate
            from the HTML itself. For example, Robert Raisch made a proposal in 1993 to
            create a separate format to hold styling information,
        </p>

        <blockquote class="css-history">
            “There is a need within the WWW to be able to specify rendering
            specific information along with the content tagging in a WWW document.
            It is not appropriate to use HTML for this purpose, since one of the
            first principles of HTML is to encode objects within a document, not how
            they might be rendered in a particular environment.”
            -Robert Raisch<sup><a href="http://1997.webhistory.org/www.lists/www-talk.1993q2/0445.html">4</a></sup>
        </blockquote>

        <p id="p2" class="css-history">
            Among Raisch and Wei there were proposals made for other style sheets
            before CSS.<sup><a href="https://www.w3.org/Style/History/Overview.en.html">5</a></sup>
            <br>

            In October of 1994 Tim Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium(W3C).
            <sup><a href="https://www.w3.org/News/1994.">6</a></sup>
            The W3C played in an important role in standardizing web
            languages and practices. Around the same time in 1994,
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%A5kon_Wium_Lie">Hakon W. Lie</a>
            proposed a rough draft of CSS called Cascading HTML Style Sheets.
            <sup><a href="https://www.w3.org/People/howcome/p/cascade.html">7</a></sup>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bert_Bos">Bert Bos</a>
            responded to Hakon W. Lie’s proposal. Bert Bos was working on an another
            styling language for the browser Argo, called
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/People/Bos/style.html">Stream-based Style Sheet Proposal</a> or (SSP).

        </p>

        <p id="p3" class="css-history">
            In 1995 Hakon W Lie and Bert Bos released Cascading Style Sheets Level 1
            <sup><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WD-css1-951117.html ">8</a></sup>
            , which allowed the style sheet authors to change the presentation of HTML files
            with fonts colors and layout. With the W3C gaining popularity by companies that wanted
            to comply to its' standards, browsers began to implement CSS recommendations.
            Microsoft released Internet Explorer 3.0 in 1996, which was the first widely
            used browser with CSS support.
            <sup><a href="https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/msie/">9</a></sup>
            Other browsers such as Netscape and Opera followed shortly after.
            <sup><a href="https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS20/history.html">10</a></sup>
            Drafts for the next CSS specification, CSS2 began in 1997 and stated that the editors
            wanted to consider both 'CSS authors and CSS implementers'
            <sup><a href="https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS20/history.html">11</a></sup>
        </p>

        <p id="p4" class="css-history">
            In 2000 Internet Explorer 5 for Macintosh was released by Microsoft.
            <sup><a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/The_history_of_the_Web">12</a></sup>
            It was the default installed browser for Mac computers,
            since this was before Safari, but the significance was that it took
            many of the W3C recommendations for CSS. This was a big step for
            standardizing web practices, but how different browsers implemented CSS
            caused bugs and made things difficult on developers.
            They made hacks and workarounds to make CSS work how they wanted.
            An example of this was the CSS box model. The box model helps specify
            how the HTML elements are spaced and displayed on the page. Internet
            explorer had its own box model that differed from the W3C model in the
            way it calculated the total width of elements with padding and margins.
            <sup><a
                    href="https://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200612/internet_explorer_and_the_css_box_model/">13</a></sup>
            Many preferred Internet Explorer’s version, because it counted the margin
            and padding space around the element as part of the total width of the content.
            Though W3C standardized its own box model version in 2001,
            <sup><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2001/WD-css3-box-20010726/ ">14</a></sup>
            some designers were still using work-arounds to get IE's version in the 2010s.
