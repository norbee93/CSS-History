            CSS Grid Layout is useful for dividing a page into areas
            based on column and row lines. Like Flexbox, a Grid container
            is defined in CSS, and all elements inside the container become
            Grid elements that can be positioned based on the Grid lines.

            According to
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bert_Bos">Bert Bos</a>,
            he had thought about grid-based web layouts for CSS, because
            he wanted to capture elements of book and magazine layouts.
            <sup><a href="https://alistapart.com/article/the-story-of-css-grid-from-its-creators/">2</a></sup>
            The W3C had received grid-based layout proposals before 2011,
            but this was the first that had implementation to consider.
            The 2011 Grid proposal includes comparison to tables, in the way
            that elements can be aligned with rows and columns but allows for
            more variety of layouts that are not possible with table based layout.
            Grid is designed to be easier than table or float based layouts, to
            adapt layouts to available space. It also offers a more ideal way of
            overlapping elements, where position is determined by grid lines. It
            was previously difficult to overlap elements in a flexible way.

            In the 2013 draft of Grid, it was included that Grid was intended to be a
            two-dimensional system. This differed from Flexbox, in which 2 dimensional
            layout was only possible by nesting flex container boxes.

            Rachel Andrew, a web developer and Invited Expert of the CSS Working Group,
            <sup><a href="https://24ways.org/2012/css3-grid-layout/#author ">5</a></sup>
            was an early experimenter with CSS, after she attended a lecture about grid-based layouts by Bert Bos.
            She made <a href="https://gridbyexample.com/">examples</a> to help people learn CSS Grid Layout.

            It is also possible to make a nested Grid, such as the form below. The form element is a Grid container
            and the form elements are also Grid elements. Grid can be useful for layout of whole pages as well
            as elements on the page.
