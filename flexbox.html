            The first W3C specification for CSS Flexible box layout (Flexbox) was released in 2009.
            The main purpose of flexbox was to create an additional box model in which a parent element
            acts as the ‘container’ and the elements inside of the container, or its children, can be
            distributed horizontally or vertically across the size of the container. The container can
            adjust to different sizes as a user may change the browser window size. The developer would
            specify how the child elements would distribute space or expand to fill the container. The
            specification also states that these container boxes may be nested to create layouts utilizing
            both dimensions. <sup><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2009/WD-css3-flexbox-20090723/">1</a></sup>

            <a href="https://twitter.com/tabatkins?lang=en">Tab Atkins Jr</a> is a current editor of CSS specifications
            and became an editor
            of the Flexbox specification in 2011<sup><a
                    href="http://annairish.github.io/historicizing/history">2</a></sup>
            and in 2013 Atkins rewrote a draft of Flexbox that made it more efficient.
            <sup><a href="https://medium.com/@BennyOgidan/history-of-css-grid-and-css-flexbox-658ae6cfe6d2 ">3</a></sup>
            The following year in 2014, Atkins gave a presentation at a web conference in which he
            described the 4 main layout operations of Flexbox: direction, alignment, ordering and flexibility.
            There are CSS properties based on these operations that are designed to be used together. These
            Flexbox operations can simplify CSS tasks that were previously tricky. An example Atkins gives
            is making a centered horizontal navigation bar. The solution was to make the navigation bar as
            an unordered list and have that be the parent container. The list items would be
            the navigation links and flex items that are children of the container element ul.
            The list items are centered and with 3 simple CSS rules it is possible to make a flexible
            centered horizontal navigation bar.This method also ensures that spacing the elements doesn’t
            rely on padding, which doesn’talways scale to different sizes well.
